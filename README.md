# Gata

An easy-to-use data validation crate built in Rust.

## Purpose

The purpose of this crate is to provide commonly used regex patterns, and procedural macros that allow for data validation on structs, that can be easily dropped into applications. It is built with people who have never used regex in mind and is therefore designed to be as simple as possible.

## Inspiration

This create is inspired by the [`validator`](https://github.com/Keats/validator) crate, but with a focus on regex as well as data validation. Please go give it a star! ❤️
